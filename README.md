# Customer_Segmentation_with_K_Means_Clustering

## Applying K-Means Clustering to Segment Customers into viable groups. 

### Introduction:

There are many models for clustering out there. In this Project, I will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-Means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this Project, I will demonstrate how to use K-Means for Customer Segmentation.

#### Some real-world applications of k-Means:

* Customer segmentation
* Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
* Pattern recognition
* Machine learning
* Data compression

### Scope:

**In this Project, I will demonstrate k-Means clustering with 2 examples:-**

1. k-Means on a random generated dataset
2. Using k-Means for customer segmentation

### Project Structure:

* **K-Means on randomly Generated dataset**
  * Setting up K-Means
  * Creating the visual plot

* **Customer Segmentation with K-Means**
  * Data Pre-processing
  * Modelling
  * Insights

### Limitations of K-means Clustering:

* We can only learn hyperspheres as cluster boundaries.
* We have to specify the number of clusters we expect.
* Another huge disadvantage of k-Means is that it considers the entire data set in its centroids, including outliers.
* K-Means cannot distinguish noise from cluster groupings
* It might also identify clusters incorrectly due to its dependence on centroid placements.
